## Overview
In an effort to work on practical development skills and economize my job search efforts, this project is intended to aggregate data from a number of specialty platforms that post information regarding new software development opportunities. Ultimately, I'd like to have the information housed in a database attached to a UI.

## Project Status
In initial planning and development.

## Usage
Presently this project is intended for personal usage. If my work interests others and can make their job searches easier, then it may be expanded to allow others access.

## Roadmap
* Build initial logic to fetch data from relevant websites and write it to a local file.
* Connect the webscraping logic to a back-end database.
* Create a frontend UI that allows easier access to the database.
* Expand to allow other, general users?
